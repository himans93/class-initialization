Summary
Throwing exceptions in constructors is a valid technique for handling errors that prevent an object from being properly constructed. However, there are alternatives that can provide clearer and more flexible error handling strategies:

Factory Functions: Encapsulate construction and error handling in a factory function.
Two-Phase Initialization: Separate initialization logic from the constructor.
Using std::optional: Use std::optional to indicate the possibility of construction failure without exceptions.


**Factory Functions:**

**Purpose:** These functions provide an alternative way to create objects, often encapsulating complex creation logic or offering a more expressive interface than constructors.
**How they Work:**
A static member function (or a free function) is used to create and return objects of a class.
This allows for more flexibility in:
Performing operations before returning the object.
Returning objects by value or pointers (including std::unique_ptr for ownership management).
Choosing different constructors based on input parameters.

**Error Handling:**
Factories can use various error-handling techniques:
Exceptions: Throw exceptions to signal errors.
Return Codes: Return specific codes or error objects.
Optional Types: Return std::optional<T> to indicate success or failure.
